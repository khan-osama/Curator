# Curator
An application that lets the user get art curated recommendations for them based on the century of art they choose! It will also let users save art that they particularly like and view their favorites in a seperate list. Users may also search for art using the artist name!

##What I learned from this project:

1. Designing a full application by yourself is challenging but also rewarding. The UI/UX heavily impacts how a user is going to digest that information and it was important for the user to be able to experience the art with a minimal and clean design so the art could be emphasized versus the UI elements.

2. A lot of APIs are messy and this was my first experience integrating an API into a project. I was lucky enough to find a great API that included rich text details with beautiful images that allowed me to present the art with high-resolution.

3. The use of data models was essential for this project as it helped me learn how data is kept persistent during a user's browsing session. Data models help with loading the correct data in while also unloading any data that was unnecessary. This was particularly useful with the 'favorites' feature that was implemented.
